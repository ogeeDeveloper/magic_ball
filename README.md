## About The Project

The Magic 8-Ball App is a fun, interactive way to make everyday decisions with a bit of unpredictability. From the course The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart by Angela Yu, this app brings the magic 8-ball experience right to your smartphone.

## Features

- **Sleek Design**: A clean and intuitive interface for an engaging user experience.
- **Randomized Answers**: With multiple possible answers, each tap brings a new perspective.

## Widgets Used

In this project, we've used a number of Flutter's versatile widgets to bring our Magic 8-Ball App to life:

- `AppBar`: A Material Design app bar that provides identity and action control to our app.
- `Column`: A vertical arrangement for our app's body content.
- `Expanded`: A flexible widget that expands to fill the available space in our `Column`.
- `TextButton`: A simple button to detect taps that also provides feedback.

### Why These Widgets?

Each widget was selected for its role in creating a seamless and effective user experience:

- `AppBar` offers a familiar and accessible way for users to navigate and understand the app's purpose.
- `Column` and `Expanded` work together to manage layout and presentation, ensuring our magic 8-ball remains center stage.
- `TextButton` is an accessible, intuitive control for users to interact with the magic 8-ball.
